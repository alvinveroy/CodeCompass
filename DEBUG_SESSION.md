## Summary of Historical Debugging Efforts (Attempts 66 through 91)

The debugging process (spanning commits from approximately `7f14f61` to `691bb8f`) has focused on achieving a clean build and resolving numerous test failures across unit and integration tests.

**1. SUT Mocking in `src/tests/index.test.ts` (Unit Tests for CLI):**
    *   **Initial Problem:** The System Under Test (`src/index.ts`), when dynamically imported by the `runMainWithArgs` helper, consistently failed to use mocks defined in `src/tests/index.test.ts`. This resulted in widespread "spy not called" errors.
    *   **Evolution & Fixes:**
        *   Shifted from testing `dist/index.js` to directly testing `src/index.ts` to align with CI practices and improve mock applicability.
        *   Addressed `tsc` errors in `src/index.ts` (e.g., `await` in non-async yargs `.fail()` handler - fixed around commit `e107328`) that prevented the SUT from loading correctly.
        *   Iteratively refined `vi.mock` calls in `src/tests/index.test.ts`. This involved:
            *   Debugging path resolution for dynamic `require` calls made by the SUT. Ensured `libPath` in `src/index.ts` correctly resolved to `src/lib` and used `.ts` extensions when `VITEST_WORKER_ID` was set.
            *   Tackled `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'variable' before initialization` (e.g., `__vi_import_0__`, `serverTsAbsolutePath`) due to Vitest's mock hoisting. The solution evolved towards using static string literals (e.g., `../../src/lib/server.ts`) as path arguments to `vi.mock`, as dynamically constructed paths (even with `path.join` or `path.resolve` at the top level) proved problematic for hoisting.
    *   **Key Challenge Remaining (as of Attempt 91):** The `ReferenceError` related to `vi.mock` path hoisting in `src/tests/index.test.ts` persisted, indicating that the strategy for specifying mock paths for the SUT's dynamically imported dependencies was still not fully robust against Vitest's hoisting mechanism.

**2. Integration Tests (`src/tests/integration/stdio-client-server.integration.test.ts`):**
    *   **Environment Variable Propagation to SUT:**
        *   **Problem:** Critical environment variables (e.g., `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_LLM`, `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_QDRANT`), intended to activate SUT-internal mocks, were not reaching the spawned SUT child process. This was a major blocker, causing the SUT to attempt real operations or use default providers.
        *   **Evolution:** Diagnostics confirmed variables were set in the test's `currentTestSpawnEnv`. Investigation focused on `StdioClientTransport` from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. Analysis of the SDK's `stdio.js` (around Attempt 88, commit `b8f8e12`) revealed that `env` options needed to be passed as a top-level property in the transport parameters, not nested under an `options` property.
        *   **Status (as of Attempt 91):** `tsc` errors related to `StdioTransportParams` (TS2353) and `env` object typing in `src/index.ts` (TS2322 for `serverProcessParams.env`) were identified. While the `StdioClientTransport` instantiation in tests was corrected (commit `691bb8f`), the SUT-side `tsc` errors for `env` object construction in `handleClientCommand` (and the fundamental propagation via the SDK) remained critical.
    *   **Qdrant Mocking (`trigger_repository_update` test):**
        *   **Problem:** Test failed as the SUT appeared not to use its Qdrant mock, or logs from the mock were not captured.
        *   **Evolution:** Extensive diagnostics were added. Confirmed `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_QDRANT=true` was intended to activate the mock. Traced calls to `batchUpsertVectors`. Ensured the mock client's `upsert` method in `src/lib/qdrant.ts` matched the real client's API and logged a specific message (`[MOCK_QDRANT_UPSERT]`).
        *   A breakthrough occurred around commit `871ebe9` where SUT logs confirmed `IsMock: true` for the Qdrant client and that `client.upsert` was the correct mocked function. However, the `console.error` log from this mock was not captured by the test. This regressed later (e.g., commit `a57a437` showed `IsMock: false`) due to the overarching environment variable propagation failure.
    *   **LLM Mocking & Assertions (`agent_query`, `generate_suggestion`, etc.):**
        *   **Problem:** Tests frequently failed due to mismatches between expected SUT self-mocked LLM responses (often simple "SUT_SELF_MOCK:..." strings) and actual detailed markdown/code outputs from the SUT, or tools not being found.
        *   **Evolution:** Assertions were adjusted multiple times. The core issue was often traced back to the SUT's `createMockLLMProvider` not being used (because `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_LLM` was not propagated to the SUT) or its internal `if` conditions for specific prompts not being met, causing fall-through to more generic mock responses or attempts to use real providers.
    *   **Session State (`get_session_history`):** An early issue involved stale session history. This was temporarily mitigated by adjusting assertions to isolate the bug, but the root cause became secondary to the more fundamental mocking and environment variable issues.

**3. `src/tests/server.test.ts` (`startProxyServer` Timeouts):**
    *   **Problem:** Four tests in this suite consistently timed out.
    *   **Status:** This issue was largely deferred throughout the debugging process due to the higher priority of `index.test.ts` SUT mocking and integration test environment/mocking issues. Lack of clear diagnostic logs from the SUT in these specific test runs hindered direct progress.

**4. TypeScript Compilation (`tsc`) Errors:**
    *   Several `tsc` errors were encountered and fixed, including:
        *   `await` used in non-async functions (e.g., yargs `.fail()` handler).
        *   Type mismatches for environment variables being passed to child processes (`string | undefined` vs. `string`).
        *   Incorrect typings or property placement for SDK parameters (e.g., `StdioTransportParams` and `env` property).

**Overall Retrospection:**
The debugging journey involved extensive work on Vitest mocking for dynamically imported SUT dependencies, managing environment variable propagation to child processes spawned by tests, and ensuring correct path resolution for module loading in various contexts (source vs. packaged, test execution vs. direct run). Key challenges included Vitest's mock hoisting behavior with non-literal paths, issues with the external `StdioClientTransport` SDK's handling of environment variables, and cascading failures where `tsc` errors or SUT crashes obscured underlying test logic problems. The process underscored the necessity of meticulous diagnostic logging and iterative refinement of both SUT code (for testability) and the test setups themselves.

## Attempt 99: Finalizing `indexPath` Scope Correction

*   **Attempt Number:** 99
*   **Last Git Commit for this attempt's changes:** `033ad35` ("fix: Fix params passed to imported startServer in handler")
*   **Intended Fixes (from Attempt 98):**
    *   **`src/index.ts`:** Correct the parameters passed to the imported `startServer` function *within* `startServerHandler`. (This was addressed by commit `033ad35`).
*   **Applied Changes (leading to current state):**
    *   Commit `033ad35` was applied.
*   **Current Errors (based on user report for `src/index.ts` after `033ad35`):**
    *   The user reports errors on lines 474 and 566 (updated line numbers) in `src/index.ts` related to `indexPath`. These lines are the call sites of `startServerHandler` within the `main()` function (SUT mode block and yargs default command handler).
    *   Commit `9849337` correctly modified the `startServerHandler` signature to accept `currentProcessIndexPath` and updated the call sites in `main()` (SUT mode and yargs default command handler) to pass `indexPath`.
    *   Commit `033ad35` correctly fixed the call *inside* `startServerHandler` to the imported `startServer` (from `src/lib/server.ts`) so it no longer incorrectly receives `indexPath`.
    *   The current error indicates that the `indexPath` variable itself is not found at the call sites within `main()`. This is unexpected as `indexPath` is defined at the module scope.
*   **Analysis/Retrospection:**
    *   `indexPath` is defined at the top of `src/index.ts`.
    *   `startServerHandler` is defined in `src/index.ts` and correctly accepts `currentProcessIndexPath`.
    *   The `main` function is also defined in `src/index.ts`.
    *   The calls to `startServerHandler` from within `main` (both in SUT mode and the yargs default command handler) *should* have access to the module-scoped `indexPath`.
    *   If `indexPath` is reported as "Cannot find name 'indexPath'" at these call sites, it suggests a very subtle scoping issue or perhaps an error in how the `SEARCH/REPLACE` blocks were applied or interpreted, leading to `indexPath` being undefined in the context of those specific lines within `main`.
*   **Next Steps/Plan (Attempt 99):**
    1.  **`DEBUG_SESSION.MD`:** Update with this analysis (this step).
    2.  **`src/index.ts` (Verify `indexPath` at call sites in `main`):**
        *   The `SEARCH/REPLACE` blocks from commit `9849337` that modified the calls to `startServerHandler` in `main` (lines 474 and 566) were:
            *   `await startServerHandler({ ... }, indexPath);` for SUT mode.
            *   `await startServerHandler(argv as { ... }, indexPath);` for yargs default command.
        *   These appear correct. The issue might be that `indexPath` itself is somehow shadowed or not available *exactly* at those lines within the `main` function's scope. This is unlikely given its module-level definition.
        *   Let's ensure the `indexPath` variable is indeed defined at the top of the file and not inadvertently moved or redefined. Assuming it is correctly at the top, the previous fixes should be sufficient.
        *   No new code change is proposed for `src/index.ts` at this moment, as the previous changes for these lines *should* be correct. The user should double-check that `indexPath` is defined at the top of `src/index.ts` as:
            `const indexPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../src/index.ts');`
            And that the calls on lines 474 and 566 are indeed passing this `indexPath`.
    3.  **Verification:** User to run `npm run build` to:
        *   Confirm if `tsc` errors related to `indexPath` on lines 474 and 566 persist. If they do, we need to see the exact code around those lines and the definition of `indexPath`.
        *   Observe the output for the SUT mode crash.
        *   Observe the results for unit tests.

### Blockers
    *   Reported `Cannot find name 'indexPath'` errors at call sites of `startServerHandler` in `main()`.
    *   SUT crashing in integration tests.
    *   Unit test "promise resolved instead of rejecting" errors.
