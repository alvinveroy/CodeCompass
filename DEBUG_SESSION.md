## Summary of Historical Debugging Efforts (Attempts 66 through 91)

The debugging process (spanning commits from approximately `7f14f61` to `691bb8f`) has focused on achieving a clean build and resolving numerous test failures across unit and integration tests.

**1. SUT Mocking in `src/tests/index.test.ts` (Unit Tests for CLI):**
    *   **Initial Problem:** The System Under Test (`src/index.ts`), when dynamically imported by the `runMainWithArgs` helper, consistently failed to use mocks defined in `src/tests/index.test.ts`. This resulted in widespread "spy not called" errors.
    *   **Evolution & Fixes:**
        *   Shifted from testing `dist/index.js` to directly testing `src/index.ts` to align with CI practices and improve mock applicability.
        *   Addressed `tsc` errors in `src/index.ts` (e.g., `await` in non-async yargs `.fail()` handler - fixed around commit `e107328`) that prevented the SUT from loading correctly.
        *   Iteratively refined `vi.mock` calls in `src/tests/index.test.ts`. This involved:
            *   Debugging path resolution for dynamic `require` calls made by the SUT. Ensured `libPath` in `src/index.ts` correctly resolved to `src/lib` and used `.ts` extensions when `VITEST_WORKER_ID` was set.
            *   Tackled `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'variable' before initialization` (e.g., `__vi_import_0__`, `serverTsAbsolutePath`) due to Vitest's mock hoisting. The solution evolved towards using static string literals (e.g., `../../src/lib/server.ts`) as path arguments to `vi.mock`, as dynamically constructed paths (even with `path.join` or `path.resolve` at the top level) proved problematic for hoisting.
    *   **Key Challenge Remaining (as of Attempt 91):** The `ReferenceError` related to `vi.mock` path hoisting in `src/tests/index.test.ts` persisted, indicating that the strategy for specifying mock paths for the SUT's dynamically imported dependencies was still not fully robust against Vitest's hoisting mechanism.

**2. Integration Tests (`src/tests/integration/stdio-client-server.integration.test.ts`):**
    *   **Environment Variable Propagation to SUT:**
        *   **Problem:** Critical environment variables (e.g., `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_LLM`, `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_QDRANT`), intended to activate SUT-internal mocks, were not reaching the spawned SUT child process. This was a major blocker, causing the SUT to attempt real operations or use default providers.
        *   **Evolution:** Diagnostics confirmed variables were set in the test's `currentTestSpawnEnv`. Investigation focused on `StdioClientTransport` from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. Analysis of the SDK's `stdio.js` (around Attempt 88, commit `b8f8e12`) revealed that `env` options needed to be passed as a top-level property in the transport parameters, not nested under an `options` property.
        *   **Status (as of Attempt 91):** `tsc` errors related to `StdioTransportParams` (TS2353) and `env` object typing in `src/index.ts` (TS2322 for `serverProcessParams.env`) were identified. While the `StdioClientTransport` instantiation in tests was corrected (commit `691bb8f`), the SUT-side `tsc` errors for `env` object construction in `handleClientCommand` (and the fundamental propagation via the SDK) remained critical.
    *   **Qdrant Mocking (`trigger_repository_update` test):**
        *   **Problem:** Test failed as the SUT appeared not to use its Qdrant mock, or logs from the mock were not captured.
        *   **Evolution:** Extensive diagnostics were added. Confirmed `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_QDRANT=true` was intended to activate the mock. Traced calls to `batchUpsertVectors`. Ensured the mock client's `upsert` method in `src/lib/qdrant.ts` matched the real client's API and logged a specific message (`[MOCK_QDRANT_UPSERT]`).
        *   A breakthrough occurred around commit `871ebe9` where SUT logs confirmed `IsMock: true` for the Qdrant client and that `client.upsert` was the correct mocked function. However, the `console.error` log from this mock was not captured by the test. This regressed later (e.g., commit `a57a437` showed `IsMock: false`) due to the overarching environment variable propagation failure.
    *   **LLM Mocking & Assertions (`agent_query`, `generate_suggestion`, etc.):**
        *   **Problem:** Tests frequently failed due to mismatches between expected SUT self-mocked LLM responses (often simple "SUT_SELF_MOCK:..." strings) and actual detailed markdown/code outputs from the SUT, or tools not being found.
        *   **Evolution:** Assertions were adjusted multiple times. The core issue was often traced back to the SUT's `createMockLLMProvider` not being used (because `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_LLM` was not propagated to the SUT) or its internal `if` conditions for specific prompts not being met, causing fall-through to more generic mock responses or attempts to use real providers.
    *   **Session State (`get_session_history`):** An early issue involved stale session history. This was temporarily mitigated by adjusting assertions to isolate the bug, but the root cause became secondary to the more fundamental mocking and environment variable issues.

**3. `src/tests/server.test.ts` (`startProxyServer` Timeouts):**
    *   **Problem:** Four tests in this suite consistently timed out.
    *   **Status:** This issue was largely deferred throughout the debugging process due to the higher priority of `index.test.ts` SUT mocking and integration test environment/mocking issues. Lack of clear diagnostic logs from the SUT in these specific test runs hindered direct progress.

**4. TypeScript Compilation (`tsc`) Errors:**
    *   Several `tsc` errors were encountered and fixed, including:
        *   `await` used in non-async functions (e.g., yargs `.fail()` handler).
        *   Type mismatches for environment variables being passed to child processes (`string | undefined` vs. `string`).
        *   Incorrect typings or property placement for SDK parameters (e.g., `StdioTransportParams` and `env` property).

**Overall Retrospection:**
The debugging journey involved extensive work on Vitest mocking for dynamically imported SUT dependencies, managing environment variable propagation to child processes spawned by tests, and ensuring correct path resolution for module loading in various contexts (source vs. packaged, test execution vs. direct run). Key challenges included Vitest's mock hoisting behavior with non-literal paths, issues with the external `StdioClientTransport` SDK's handling of environment variables, and cascading failures where `tsc` errors or SUT crashes obscured underlying test logic problems. The process underscored the necessity of meticulous diagnostic logging and iterative refinement of both SUT code (for testability) and the test setups themselves.

## Attempt 93: Addressing Build Failures (tsc errors, unit & integration test failures)

*   **Attempt Number:** 93
*   **Last Git Commit for this attempt's changes:** `4ab9c39` ("fix: Correct StdioClientTransport params structure and type")
*   **Intended Fixes (from previous attempts & current analysis):**
    *   Correct `StdioClientTransport` parameters in `src/tests/integration/stdio-client-server.integration.test.ts` (Commit `4ab9c39`).
    *   Address `tsc` errors and widespread test failures reported by `npm run build`.
*   **Applied Changes (leading to current build output):**
    *   Commit `4ab9c39` was applied.
*   **Result (Based on User's `npm run build` Output):**
    *   **`tsc` Errors:**
        *   `src/index.ts:253:5 - error TS2353: Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'stdio' does not exist in type 'StdioServerParameters'.` The `stdio` property in `serverProcessParams` within `handleClientCommand` is incorrectly placed. It should likely be nested under an `options` property along with `env`.
        *   `src/tests/index.test.ts:724:120 - error TS2345: Argument of type '{ readonly jsonrpc: "2.0"; ... }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | RegExp | Error | Constructable | undefined'.` The `toThrowError` matcher is being used with a plain object (`rpcError`) instead of an `Error` instance or compatible argument.
    *   **Integration Test Failures (`src/tests/integration/stdio-client-server.integration.test.ts`):**
        *   All 9 tests fail with `MCP error -32000: Connection closed`.
        *   The SUT's stdout reveals the root cause: `TypeError: directStartServerHandler is not a function at main (/Users/alvin.tech/Projects/CodeCompass/src/index.ts:452:13)`. This occurs when `src/index.ts` is run in `--cc-integration-test-sut-mode`. The `main()` function in this mode incorrectly tries to import `startServerHandler` from `src/lib/server.ts` instead of calling its own `startServerHandler` function.
    *   **Unit Test Failures (`src/tests/index.test.ts`):**
        *   `mockStartServerHandler` called with `indexPath` (e.g., `/Users/.../src/index.ts`) as `repoPath` instead of the expected default (`.`) or specified path. This is due to how `yargs` parses arguments when `runMainWithArgs` simulates CLI calls, particularly for the default command.
        *   Multiple tests expecting promises to reject (e.g., `process.exit` calls, `ServerStartupError`) are finding that the promises resolve successfully. This points to issues in error propagation within the SUT's `main()` function or `yargs.fail()` handler in the test environment.
        *   `mockStdioClientTransportConstructor` is not called in client tool command tests, suggesting `handleClientCommand` in `src/index.ts` is not reached or fails early.
        *   The `changelog` test fails because `mockedFsSpies.readFileSync` is called with `package.json` first (by `getPackageVersion`), but the mock is not set up to handle this, leading to an incorrect value being returned or an error, and the subsequent assertion for `CHANGELOG.md` content fails.
    *   **Server Test Timeouts (`src/tests/server.test.ts`):**
        *   4 tests in the `startProxyServer` suite are still timing out (known deferred issue).
*   **Analysis/Retrospection:**
    *   The `StdioServerParameters` structure in `src/index.ts` needs to be definitively corrected to match the SDK.
    *   The SUT crash in integration tests is a clear bug in `src/index.ts`'s SUT mode logic.
    *   The `toThrowError` usage in `src/tests/index.test.ts` is incorrect for non-Error objects.
    *   Unit test failures in `src/tests/index.test.ts` stem from a combination of:
        *   Incorrect `repoPath` argument parsing for the default yargs command.
        *   Potential issues with how errors (especially from mocked `process.exit`) are propagated through `yargs` and the SUT's `main` function in tests.
        *   Incomplete mocking for `fs.readFileSync` in the changelog test.
*   **Next Steps/Plan (Attempt 93):**
    1.  **`DEBUG_SESSION.MD`:** Update with this analysis (this step).
    2.  **`src/index.ts` (Critical SUT Fixes):**
        *   **Fix `TypeError: directStartServerHandler is not a function`:** In the `main()` function, when `process.argv.includes('--cc-integration-test-sut-mode')` is true, ensure it calls the `startServerHandler` function defined *within* `src/index.ts` itself, not attempt to import it.
        *   **Fix TS2353 (`StdioServerParameters`):** In `handleClientCommand`, ensure `serverProcessParams` correctly structures `env` and `stdio` (likely nested under an `options` property) to match the `StdioServerParameters` type from the SDK.
    3.  **`src/tests/index.test.ts` (Test & TSC Fixes):**
        *   **Fix TS2345 (`toThrowError`):** In the test `should output JSON error when --json flag is used and tool call fails with JSON-RPC error (stdio)`, change `expect(...).rejects.toThrowError(rpcError)` to `expect(...).rejects.toThrow(expect.objectContaining({ message: expect.stringContaining(rpcError.error.message) }))` or a similar check if the actual rejected value is an Error instance wrapping the RPC error details.
        *   **Fix `changelog` test:** Update the `mockedFsSpies.readFileSync` mock to correctly return content for both `package.json` (for `getPackageVersion`) and `CHANGELOG.md`.
        *   **Address `mockStartServerHandler` argument issue:** Modify `runMainWithArgs` to ensure that when testing the default command with no explicit repository path, `yargs` correctly defaults `repoPath` to `.`. This might involve explicitly passing `start` as the command in such cases.
    4.  **Re-evaluate remaining `src/tests/index.test.ts` failures** (promise resolved instead of rejecting, `mockStdioClientTransportConstructor` not called) after the above fixes, as they might be interdependent.
    5.  **Defer `server.test.ts` Timeouts.**
