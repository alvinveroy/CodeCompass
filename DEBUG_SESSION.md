# CodeCompass Debugging Session Log

**Overall Goal:** Achieve a clean build (`npm run build` with no TypeScript/transform errors and all tests passing).

## Summary of Historical Debugging Efforts (Attempts 66 through 91)

The debugging process (spanning commits from approximately `7f14f61` to `691bb8f`) has focused on achieving a clean build and resolving numerous test failures across unit and integration tests.

**1. SUT Mocking in `src/tests/index.test.ts` (Unit Tests for CLI):**
    *   **Initial Problem:** The System Under Test (`src/index.ts`), when dynamically imported by the `runMainWithArgs` helper, consistently failed to use mocks defined in `src/tests/index.test.ts`. This resulted in widespread "spy not called" errors.
    *   **Evolution & Fixes:**
        *   Shifted from testing `dist/index.js` to directly testing `src/index.ts` to align with CI practices and improve mock applicability.
        *   Addressed `tsc` errors in `src/index.ts` (e.g., `await` in non-async yargs `.fail()` handler - fixed around commit `e107328`) that prevented the SUT from loading correctly.
        *   Iteratively refined `vi.mock` calls in `src/tests/index.test.ts`. This involved:
            *   Debugging path resolution for dynamic `require` calls made by the SUT. Ensured `libPath` in `src/index.ts` correctly resolved to `src/lib` and used `.ts` extensions when `VITEST_WORKER_ID` was set.
            *   Tackled `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'variable' before initialization` (e.g., `__vi_import_0__`, `serverTsAbsolutePath`) due to Vitest's mock hoisting. The solution evolved towards using static string literals (e.g., `../../src/lib/server.ts`) as path arguments to `vi.mock`, as dynamically constructed paths (even with `path.join` or `path.resolve` at the top level) proved problematic for hoisting.
    *   **Key Challenge Remaining (as of Attempt 91):** The `ReferenceError` related to `vi.mock` path hoisting in `src/tests/index.test.ts` persisted, indicating that the strategy for specifying mock paths for the SUT's dynamically imported dependencies was still not fully robust against Vitest's hoisting mechanism.

**2. Integration Tests (`src/tests/integration/stdio-client-server.integration.test.ts`):**
    *   **Environment Variable Propagation to SUT:**
        *   **Problem:** Critical environment variables (e.g., `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_LLM`, `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_QDRANT`), intended to activate SUT-internal mocks, were not reaching the spawned SUT child process. This was a major blocker, causing the SUT to attempt real operations or use default providers.
        *   **Evolution:** Diagnostics confirmed variables were set in the test's `currentTestSpawnEnv`. Investigation focused on `StdioClientTransport` from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. Analysis of the SDK's `stdio.js` (around Attempt 88, commit `b8f8e12`) revealed that `env` options needed to be passed as a top-level property in the transport parameters, not nested under an `options` property.
        *   **Status (as of Attempt 91):** `tsc` errors related to `StdioTransportParams` (TS2353) and `env` object typing in `src/index.ts` (TS2322 for `serverProcessParams.env`) were identified. While the `StdioClientTransport` instantiation in tests was corrected (commit `691bb8f`), the SUT-side `tsc` errors for `env` object construction in `handleClientCommand` (and the fundamental propagation via the SDK) remained critical.
    *   **Qdrant Mocking (`trigger_repository_update` test):**
        *   **Problem:** Test failed as the SUT appeared not to use its Qdrant mock, or logs from the mock were not captured.
        *   **Evolution:** Extensive diagnostics were added. Confirmed `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_QDRANT=true` was intended to activate the mock. Traced calls to `batchUpsertVectors`. Ensured the mock client's `upsert` method in `src/lib/qdrant.ts` matched the real client's API and logged a specific message (`[MOCK_QDRANT_UPSERT]`).
        *   A breakthrough occurred around commit `871ebe9` where SUT logs confirmed `IsMock: true` for the Qdrant client and that `client.upsert` was the correct mocked function. However, the `console.error` log from this mock was not captured by the test. This regressed later (e.g., commit `a57a437` showed `IsMock: false`) due to the overarching environment variable propagation failure.
    *   **LLM Mocking & Assertions (`agent_query`, `generate_suggestion`, etc.):**
        *   **Problem:** Tests frequently failed due to mismatches between expected SUT self-mocked LLM responses (often simple "SUT_SELF_MOCK:..." strings) and actual detailed markdown/code outputs from the SUT, or tools not being found.
        *   **Evolution:** Assertions were adjusted multiple times. The core issue was often traced back to the SUT's `createMockLLMProvider` not being used (because `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_LLM` was not propagated to the SUT) or its internal `if` conditions for specific prompts not being met, causing fall-through to more generic mock responses or attempts to use real providers.
    *   **Session State (`get_session_history`):** An early issue involved stale session history. This was temporarily mitigated by adjusting assertions to isolate the bug, but the root cause became secondary to the more fundamental mocking and environment variable issues.

**3. `src/tests/server.test.ts` (`startProxyServer` Timeouts):**
    *   **Problem:** Four tests in this suite consistently timed out.
    *   **Status:** This issue was largely deferred throughout the debugging process due to the higher priority of `index.test.ts` SUT mocking and integration test environment/mocking issues. Lack of clear diagnostic logs from the SUT in these specific test runs hindered direct progress.

**4. TypeScript Compilation (`tsc`) Errors:**
    *   Several `tsc` errors were encountered and fixed, including:
        *   `await` used in non-async functions (e.g., yargs `.fail()` handler).
        *   Type mismatches for environment variables being passed to child processes (`string | undefined` vs. `string`).
        *   Incorrect typings or property placement for SDK parameters (e.g., `StdioTransportParams` and `env` property).

**Overall Retrospection:**
The debugging journey involved extensive work on Vitest mocking for dynamically imported SUT dependencies, managing environment variable propagation to child processes spawned by tests, and ensuring correct path resolution for module loading in various contexts (source vs. packaged, test execution vs. direct run). Key challenges included Vitest's mock hoisting behavior with non-literal paths, issues with the external `StdioClientTransport` SDK's handling of environment variables, and cascading failures where `tsc` errors or SUT crashes obscured underlying test logic problems. The process underscored the necessity of meticulous diagnostic logging and iterative refinement of both SUT code (for testability) and the test setups themselves.

## Attempt 97: Addressing `indexPath` Scope and `StdioServerParameters`

*   **Attempt Number:** 97
*   **Last Git Commit for this attempt's changes:** `78d453c` ("fix: Correct StdioServerParameters structure for SDK")
*   **Intended Fixes (from Attempt 96):**
    *   **`src/index.ts`:** Correct `StdioServerParameters` structure in `handleClientCommand` (addressed by `78d453c`).
*   **Applied Changes (leading to current state):**
    *   Commit `78d453c` was applied.
*   **Current Errors (based on user IDE report for `src/index.ts` after `78d453c` and new analysis):**
    *   `src/index.ts:240` - TS2353: This was fixed by commit `78d453c`.
    *   `src/index.ts:335` - TS2304: `Cannot find name 'indexPath'.` This error is **valid**. The `indexPath` variable is defined at the module scope in `src/index.ts`, but the `startServerHandler` function (where `indexPath` is referenced on line 335 as per commit `aa08974`) does not have `indexPath` in its local scope, nor is it passed as a parameter.
*   **Analysis/Retrospection:**
    *   The `StdioServerParameters` structure (TS2353) was correctly addressed by commit `78d453c`.
    *   The `indexPath` scope issue (TS2304) is a genuine bug introduced in commit `aa08974` when `startServerHandler` was modified to check if `positionalRepoPath` was the script path itself.
    *   The SUT mode crash (`startServerHandler is not a function`) and unit test "promise resolved instead of rejecting" errors remain the primary concerns to be verified after the `indexPath` fix.
*   **Next Steps/Plan (Attempt 97):**
    1.  **`DEBUG_SESSION.MD`:** Update with this analysis (this step).
    2.  **`src/index.ts` (Fix TS2304 - `indexPath` scope):**
        *   Modify `startServerHandler` to accept `currentProcessIndexPath` (or a similar name) as an explicit parameter.
        *   When `startServerHandler` is called from `main()` (both in SUT mode and regular CLI mode), pass the module-scoped `indexPath` variable to it.
    3.  **Verification:** User to run `npm run build` to:
        *   Confirm TS2304 (`indexPath`) is resolved.
        *   Observe the output for the SUT mode crash (diagnostics for `typeof startServerHandler` should appear).
        *   Observe the results for unit tests in `src/tests/index.test.ts` (especially "promise resolved instead of rejecting" errors).
    4.  **Defer other issues** until the build is clean and the SUT mode crash is understood.

### Blockers
    *   TS2304 error in `src/index.ts` (`Cannot find name 'indexPath'`).
    *   SUT crashing in integration tests (suspected `startServerHandler is not a function`).
    *   Unit test "promise resolved instead of rejecting" errors in `src/tests/index.test.ts`.
