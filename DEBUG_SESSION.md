## Summary of Historical Debugging Efforts (Attempts 66 through 91)

The debugging process (spanning commits from approximately `7f14f61` to `691bb8f`) has focused on achieving a clean build and resolving numerous test failures across unit and integration tests.

**1. SUT Mocking in `src/tests/index.test.ts` (Unit Tests for CLI):**
    *   **Initial Problem:** The System Under Test (`src/index.ts`), when dynamically imported by the `runMainWithArgs` helper, consistently failed to use mocks defined in `src/tests/index.test.ts`. This resulted in widespread "spy not called" errors.
    *   **Evolution & Fixes:**
        *   Shifted from testing `dist/index.js` to directly testing `src/index.ts` to align with CI practices and improve mock applicability.
        *   Addressed `tsc` errors in `src/index.ts` (e.g., `await` in non-async yargs `.fail()` handler - fixed around commit `e107328`) that prevented the SUT from loading correctly.
        *   Iteratively refined `vi.mock` calls in `src/tests/index.test.ts`. This involved:
            *   Debugging path resolution for dynamic `require` calls made by the SUT. Ensured `libPath` in `src/index.ts` correctly resolved to `src/lib` and used `.ts` extensions when `VITEST_WORKER_ID` was set.
            *   Tackled `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'variable' before initialization` (e.g., `__vi_import_0__`, `serverTsAbsolutePath`) due to Vitest's mock hoisting. The solution evolved towards using static string literals (e.g., `../../src/lib/server.ts`) as path arguments to `vi.mock`, as dynamically constructed paths (even with `path.join` or `path.resolve` at the top level) proved problematic for hoisting.
    *   **Key Challenge Remaining (as of Attempt 91):** The `ReferenceError` related to `vi.mock` path hoisting in `src/tests/index.test.ts` persisted, indicating that the strategy for specifying mock paths for the SUT's dynamically imported dependencies was still not fully robust against Vitest's hoisting mechanism.

**2. Integration Tests (`src/tests/integration/stdio-client-server.integration.test.ts`):**
    *   **Environment Variable Propagation to SUT:**
        *   **Problem:** Critical environment variables (e.g., `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_LLM`, `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_QDRANT`), intended to activate SUT-internal mocks, were not reaching the spawned SUT child process. This was a major blocker, causing the SUT to attempt real operations or use default providers.
        *   **Evolution:** Diagnostics confirmed variables were set in the test's `currentTestSpawnEnv`. Investigation focused on `StdioClientTransport` from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. Analysis of the SDK's `stdio.js` (around Attempt 88, commit `b8f8e12`) revealed that `env` options needed to be passed as a top-level property in the transport parameters, not nested under an `options` property.
        *   **Status (as of Attempt 91):** `tsc` errors related to `StdioTransportParams` (TS2353) and `env` object typing in `src/index.ts` (TS2322 for `serverProcessParams.env`) were identified. While the `StdioClientTransport` instantiation in tests was corrected (commit `691bb8f`), the SUT-side `tsc` errors for `env` object construction in `handleClientCommand` (and the fundamental propagation via the SDK) remained critical.
    *   **Qdrant Mocking (`trigger_repository_update` test):**
        *   **Problem:** Test failed as the SUT appeared not to use its Qdrant mock, or logs from the mock were not captured.
        *   **Evolution:** Extensive diagnostics were added. Confirmed `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_QDRANT=true` was intended to activate the mock. Traced calls to `batchUpsertVectors`. Ensured the mock client's `upsert` method in `src/lib/qdrant.ts` matched the real client's API and logged a specific message (`[MOCK_QDRANT_UPSERT]`).
        *   A breakthrough occurred around commit `871ebe9` where SUT logs confirmed `IsMock: true` for the Qdrant client and that `client.upsert` was the correct mocked function. However, the `console.error` log from this mock was not captured by the test. This regressed later (e.g., commit `a57a437` showed `IsMock: false`) due to the overarching environment variable propagation failure.
    *   **LLM Mocking & Assertions (`agent_query`, `generate_suggestion`, etc.):**
        *   **Problem:** Tests frequently failed due to mismatches between expected SUT self-mocked LLM responses (often simple "SUT_SELF_MOCK:..." strings) and actual detailed markdown/code outputs from the SUT, or tools not being found.
        *   **Evolution:** Assertions were adjusted multiple times. The core issue was often traced back to the SUT's `createMockLLMProvider` not being used (because `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_LLM` was not propagated to the SUT) or its internal `if` conditions for specific prompts not being met, causing fall-through to more generic mock responses or attempts to use real providers.
    *   **Session State (`get_session_history`):** An early issue involved stale session history. This was temporarily mitigated by adjusting assertions to isolate the bug, but the root cause became secondary to the more fundamental mocking and environment variable issues.

**3. `src/tests/server.test.ts` (`startProxyServer` Timeouts):**
    *   **Problem:** Four tests in this suite consistently timed out.
    *   **Status:** This issue was largely deferred throughout the debugging process due to the higher priority of `index.test.ts` SUT mocking and integration test environment/mocking issues. Lack of clear diagnostic logs from the SUT in these specific test runs hindered direct progress.

**4. TypeScript Compilation (`tsc`) Errors:**
    *   Several `tsc` errors were encountered and fixed, including:
        *   `await` used in non-async functions (e.g., yargs `.fail()` handler).
        *   Type mismatches for environment variables being passed to child processes (`string | undefined` vs. `string`).
        *   Incorrect typings or property placement for SDK parameters (e.g., `StdioTransportParams` and `env` property).

**Overall Retrospection:**
The debugging journey involved extensive work on Vitest mocking for dynamically imported SUT dependencies, managing environment variable propagation to child processes spawned by tests, and ensuring correct path resolution for module loading in various contexts (source vs. packaged, test execution vs. direct run). Key challenges included Vitest's mock hoisting behavior with non-literal paths, issues with the external `StdioClientTransport` SDK's handling of environment variables, and cascading failures where `tsc` errors or SUT crashes obscured underlying test logic problems. The process underscored the necessity of meticulous diagnostic logging and iterative refinement of both SUT code (for testability) and the test setups themselves.

## Attempt 101: Verifying `indexPath` Definition Fix

*   **Attempt Number:** 101
*   **Last Git Commit for this attempt's changes:** `4b44e12` ("fix: Define indexPath based on execution context")
*   **Intended Fixes (from Attempt 100):**
    *   **`src/index.ts`:** Define the `indexPath` variable in the module scope, determining its value based on the execution context (packaged, source, or dist).
*   **Applied Changes (leading to current state):**
    *   Commit `4b44e12` was applied, which should have defined `indexPath`.
*   **Expected Result:**
    *   The `tsc` errors "Cannot find name 'indexPath'" in `src/index.ts` (previously on lines 474 and 566) should be resolved.
*   **Attempt Number:** 103
*   **Last Git Commit for this attempt's changes:** `042e405` ("fix: Ensure SUT uses mocks; fix CLI args and test error handling")
*   **Intended Fixes (from Attempt 102):**
    *   **Integration Test Mocking (`src/index.ts`, `src/tests/integration/stdio-client-server.integration.test.ts`):**
        *   Introduced `CODECOMPASS_FORCE_SRC_PATHS_FOR_TESTING=true` env var passed from integration tests to SUT.
        *   Modified `src/index.ts` path logic (`isEffectiveVitestTesting`) to use this new variable to force `src` paths and `.ts` extensions for dynamic imports, ensuring mocks are loaded in the child SUT.
        *   Ensured `handleClientCommand` in `src/index.ts` also uses and propagates this env var.
    *   **`repoPath` Argument Handling (`src/index.ts`):**
        *   Refined `startServerHandler` to better prioritize positional `repoPath` arguments from yargs.
    *   **Promise Rejection Issues (`src/tests/index.test.ts`):**
        *   Ensured `runMainWithArgs` properly awaits `sutModule.main()` to propagate rejections.
*   **Applied Changes:**
    *   Commit `042e405` was applied. All SEARCH/REPLACE blocks were applied successfully.
    *   The one reported "failed" block for `src/index.ts` (related to the `else if (isVitestUnitTesting || ccIntegrationTestSutMode)` condition) was due to a preceding successful patch in the same file already bringing that section to the intended state (using `isEffectiveVitestTesting`). Thus, the intended change for that block was effectively applied.
*   **Result (Based on User's `npm run build` Output):**
    *   Pending user execution of `npm run build`.
*   **Analysis/Retrospection:**
    *   The core changes to force mock usage in the SUT child process (via `CODECOMPASS_FORCE_SRC_PATHS_FOR_TESTING` and `isEffectiveVitestTesting`) should significantly impact the integration test outcomes.
    *   The refined `repoPath` handling in `startServerHandler` should address some of the `src/tests/index.test.ts` failures related to incorrect repository paths.
    *   The fix in `runMainWithArgs` should help with "promise resolved instead of rejecting" errors in `src/tests/index.test.ts`.
*   **Next Steps/Plan (Attempt 103):**
    1.  **`DEBUG_SESSION.MD`:** Update with this analysis (this step).
    2.  **Verification:** User to run `npm run build` and provide the full output. This will show the impact of the applied changes.
    3.  **Analyze new build output** to determine the next set of fixes, focusing on:
        *   Whether integration tests (`stdio-client-server.integration.test.ts`) now pass or show different errors.
        *   The state of unit tests in `src/tests/index.test.ts` (repoPath issues, promise rejections, `mockStdioClientTransportConstructor` calls).
        *   The state of server tests in `src/tests/server.test.ts` (timeouts in `startProxyServer`).
        *   Any remaining unhandled rejections.
    4.  **Address `server.test.ts` Timeouts:** If they persist, investigate the `axios` unmocking strategy in the `startProxyServer` test suite's `beforeEach` hook, ensuring `axios` is unmocked *before* `serverLibModule` (which contains `startProxyServer`) is imported.
    5.  **Review Remaining `index.test.ts` Failures:**
        *   Correct `readFileSync` mock/assertion for the changelog test.
        *   Ensure `console.log` is correctly spied upon and called for JSON output tests.
        *   Further investigate `mockStdioClientTransportConstructor` not being called if this persists.

### Blockers (Anticipated based on previous state, pending new build output)
