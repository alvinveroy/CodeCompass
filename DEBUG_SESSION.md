# CodeCompass Debugging Session Log

**Overall Goal:** Achieve a clean build (`npm run build` with no TypeScript/transform errors and all tests passing).

## Summary of Historical Debugging Efforts (Attempts 66 through 91)

The debugging process (spanning commits from approximately `7f14f61` to `691bb8f`) has focused on achieving a clean build and resolving numerous test failures across unit and integration tests.

**1. SUT Mocking in `src/tests/index.test.ts` (Unit Tests for CLI):**
    *   **Initial Problem:** The System Under Test (`src/index.ts`), when dynamically imported by the `runMainWithArgs` helper, consistently failed to use mocks defined in `src/tests/index.test.ts`. This resulted in widespread "spy not called" errors.
    *   **Evolution & Fixes:**
        *   Shifted from testing `dist/index.js` to directly testing `src/index.ts` to align with CI practices and improve mock applicability.
        *   Addressed `tsc` errors in `src/index.ts` (e.g., `await` in non-async yargs `.fail()` handler - fixed around commit `e107328`) that prevented the SUT from loading correctly.
        *   Iteratively refined `vi.mock` calls in `src/tests/index.test.ts`. This involved:
            *   Debugging path resolution for dynamic `require` calls made by the SUT. Ensured `libPath` in `src/index.ts` correctly resolved to `src/lib` and used `.ts` extensions when `VITEST_WORKER_ID` was set.
            *   Tackled `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'variable' before initialization` (e.g., `__vi_import_0__`, `serverTsAbsolutePath`) due to Vitest's mock hoisting. The solution evolved towards using static string literals (e.g., `../../src/lib/server.ts`) as path arguments to `vi.mock`, as dynamically constructed paths (even with `path.join` or `path.resolve` at the top level) proved problematic for hoisting.
    *   **Key Challenge Remaining (as of Attempt 91):** The `ReferenceError` related to `vi.mock` path hoisting in `src/tests/index.test.ts` persisted, indicating that the strategy for specifying mock paths for the SUT's dynamically imported dependencies was still not fully robust against Vitest's hoisting mechanism.

**2. Integration Tests (`src/tests/integration/stdio-client-server.integration.test.ts`):**
    *   **Environment Variable Propagation to SUT:**
        *   **Problem:** Critical environment variables (e.g., `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_LLM`, `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_QDRANT`), intended to activate SUT-internal mocks, were not reaching the spawned SUT child process. This was a major blocker, causing the SUT to attempt real operations or use default providers.
        *   **Evolution:** Diagnostics confirmed variables were set in the test's `currentTestSpawnEnv`. Investigation focused on `StdioClientTransport` from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. Analysis of the SDK's `stdio.js` (around Attempt 88, commit `b8f8e12`) revealed that `env` options needed to be passed as a top-level property in the transport parameters, not nested under an `options` property.
        *   **Status (as of Attempt 91):** `tsc` errors related to `StdioTransportParams` (TS2353) and `env` object typing in `src/index.ts` (TS2322 for `serverProcessParams.env`) were identified. While the `StdioClientTransport` instantiation in tests was corrected (commit `691bb8f`), the SUT-side `tsc` errors for `env` object construction in `handleClientCommand` (and the fundamental propagation via the SDK) remained critical.
    *   **Qdrant Mocking (`trigger_repository_update` test):**
        *   **Problem:** Test failed as the SUT appeared not to use its Qdrant mock, or logs from the mock were not captured.
        *   **Evolution:** Extensive diagnostics were added. Confirmed `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_QDRANT=true` was intended to activate the mock. Traced calls to `batchUpsertVectors`. Ensured the mock client's `upsert` method in `src/lib/qdrant.ts` matched the real client's API and logged a specific message (`[MOCK_QDRANT_UPSERT]`).
        *   A breakthrough occurred around commit `871ebe9` where SUT logs confirmed `IsMock: true` for the Qdrant client and that `client.upsert` was the correct mocked function. However, the `console.error` log from this mock was not captured by the test. This regressed later (e.g., commit `a57a437` showed `IsMock: false`) due to the overarching environment variable propagation failure.
    *   **LLM Mocking & Assertions (`agent_query`, `generate_suggestion`, etc.):**
        *   **Problem:** Tests frequently failed due to mismatches between expected SUT self-mocked LLM responses (often simple "SUT_SELF_MOCK:..." strings) and actual detailed markdown/code outputs from the SUT, or tools not being found.
        *   **Evolution:** Assertions were adjusted multiple times. The core issue was often traced back to the SUT's `createMockLLMProvider` not being used (because `CODECOMPASS_INTEGRATION_TEST_MOCK_LLM` was not propagated to the SUT) or its internal `if` conditions for specific prompts not being met, causing fall-through to more generic mock responses or attempts to use real providers.
    *   **Session State (`get_session_history`):** An early issue involved stale session history. This was temporarily mitigated by adjusting assertions to isolate the bug, but the root cause became secondary to the more fundamental mocking and environment variable issues.

**3. `src/tests/server.test.ts` (`startProxyServer` Timeouts):**
    *   **Problem:** Four tests in this suite consistently timed out.
    *   **Status:** This issue was largely deferred throughout the debugging process due to the higher priority of `index.test.ts` SUT mocking and integration test environment/mocking issues. Lack of clear diagnostic logs from the SUT in these specific test runs hindered direct progress.

**4. TypeScript Compilation (`tsc`) Errors:**
    *   Several `tsc` errors were encountered and fixed, including:
        *   `await` used in non-async functions (e.g., yargs `.fail()` handler).
        *   Type mismatches for environment variables being passed to child processes (`string | undefined` vs. `string`).
        *   Incorrect typings or property placement for SDK parameters (e.g., `StdioTransportParams` and `env` property).

**Overall Retrospection:**
The debugging journey involved extensive work on Vitest mocking for dynamically imported SUT dependencies, managing environment variable propagation to child processes spawned by tests, and ensuring correct path resolution for module loading in various contexts (source vs. packaged, test execution vs. direct run). Key challenges included Vitest's mock hoisting behavior with non-literal paths, issues with the external `StdioClientTransport` SDK's handling of environment variables, and cascading failures where `tsc` errors or SUT crashes obscured underlying test logic problems. The process underscored the necessity of meticulous diagnostic logging and iterative refinement of both SUT code (for testability) and the test setups themselves.

## Attempt 101: Verifying `indexPath` Definition Fix

*   **Attempt Number:** 101
*   **Last Git Commit for this attempt's changes:** `4b44e12` ("fix: Define indexPath based on execution context")
*   **Intended Fixes (from Attempt 100):**
    *   **`src/index.ts`:** Define the `indexPath` variable in the module scope, determining its value based on the execution context (packaged, source, or dist).
*   **Applied Changes (leading to current state):**
    *   Commit `4b44e12` was applied, which should have defined `indexPath`.
*   **Expected Result:**
    *   The `tsc` errors "Cannot find name 'indexPath'" in `src/index.ts` (previously on lines 474 and 566) should be resolved.
*   **Attempt Number:** 105
*   **Last Git Commit for this attempt's changes:** `cf05956` ("fix: Correct isVitestUnitTesting ref and add proxy test nock")
*   **Intended Fixes (from Attempt 104, based on commit `cf05956`):**
    *   **`src/index.ts`:** Correct `isVitestUnitTesting` reference to `isEffectiveVitestTesting`. (This was intended, but the SEARCH/REPLACE block was redundant as the change was already present from a prior commit `042e405`).
    *   **`src/tests/server.test.ts`:**
        *   Ensure `axios` is unmocked *before* `serverLibModule` import in `startProxyServer` suite's `beforeEach`. (Applied in `2ea39d9`, carried over).
        *   Add missing `nock` interceptor for the target server in the `should start the proxy server, log info, and proxy /api/ping` test. (Applied in `cf05956`).
*   **Applied Changes:**
    *   Commit `cf05956` was applied.
    *   The fix for `src/index.ts` was already present.
    *   The `nock` interceptor fix in `src/tests/server.test.ts` was applied.
*   **Result (Based on User's `npm run build` Output after `cf05956`):**
    *   Pending user execution of `npm run build`.
*   **Analysis/Retrospection:**
    *   The `isVitestUnitTesting` ReferenceError in `src/index.ts` should now be definitively resolved as the file content reflects the correct `isEffectiveVitestTesting` variable. This should fix the `tsc` error and subsequent crashes in `index.test.ts` and `stdio-client-server.integration.test.ts`.
    *   The added `nock` interceptor in `src/tests/server.test.ts` for the `/api/ping` proxy test should resolve one of the `startProxyServer` timeouts. Other timeouts in that suite might persist if they have different root causes.
*   **Next Steps/Plan (Attempt 105):**
    1.  **`DEBUG_SESSION.MD`:** Update with this analysis (this step).
    2.  **Verification:** User to run `npm run build` and provide the full output.
    3.  **Analyze new build output,** focusing on:
        *   Confirmation that `tsc` passes.
        *   Status of `src/tests/index.test.ts` (expecting significant improvement).
        *   Status of `src/tests/integration/stdio-client-server.integration.test.ts` (expecting significant improvement).
        *   Status of `src/tests/server.test.ts`, particularly the `startProxyServer` timeouts.
    4.  If `startProxyServer` timeouts persist, further investigate the remaining failing tests in that suite (e.g., `should resolve with null if findFreePort fails`, `should handle target server unreachable for /mcp`, `should forward target server 500 error for /mcp`). This might involve checking `nock` setups for MCP calls or the mock for `findFreePort` in the error case.

### Blockers (Anticipated based on previous state, pending new build output)
    *   Remaining timeouts in `src/tests/server.test.ts` for `startProxyServer` tests if the `nock` fix wasn't comprehensive.

### Last Analyzed Commit
    *   Git Commit SHA: `cf05956` (Changes from Attempt 105 applied)
    *   Git Commit SHA for Attempt 106: `090a2a5` ("refactor: Refine repo path argument parsing logic")

## Attempt 106: Addressing Widespread Test Failures (Integration, CLI, Server Timeouts) - Results

*   **Attempt Number:** 106
*   **Last Git Commit for this attempt's changes:** `090a2a5`
*   **Intended Fixes (from this Attempt 106):**
    *   **`src/tests/integration/stdio-client-server.integration.test.ts`:** Correct the way environment variables are passed to the spawned SUT via `StdioClientTransport` to resolve "MCP error -32000: Connection closed" errors.
    *   **`src/index.ts`:** Fix argument parsing in `startServerHandler` for the explicit `start [repoPath]` command.
    *   **`src/tests/index.test.ts`:**
        *   Correct the mock path for `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js` to match ESM resolution.
        *   Adjust assertions for `readFileSync` in the changelog test.
        *   Investigate and fix tests where promises resolve instead of rejecting (e.g., for `process.exit` mocks or yargs `.fail()` handler).
        *   Investigate JSON output test failure.
    *   **`src/tests/server.test.ts`:** Addressed timeouts in `startProxyServer` tests by refining `findFreePort` error handling within `startProxyServer` and ensuring the promise chain correctly propagated `null` upon `findFreePort` rejection.
*   **Applied Changes (leading to current state):**
    *   Commit `090a2a5` applied the changes from Attempt 106.
*   **Result (Based on User's `npm run build` Output after `090a2a5`):**
    *   **TypeScript Compilation (`tsc`):**
        *   **NEW ERROR:** `src/tests/integration/stdio-client-server.integration.test.ts:280:28 - error TS2304: Cannot find name 'StdioServerParameters'.`
    *   **`src/tests/index.test.ts` (CLI Unit Tests):**
        *   **NEW ERROR:** Suite failed with `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'sdkStdioClientPath' before initialization` at `src/tests/index.test.ts:132:9`. This indicates a vi.mock hoisting issue. All 22 tests in this suite likely did not run or failed due to this setup error.
    *   **`src/tests/integration/stdio-client-server.integration.test.ts`:** All 9 tests still failing with "MCP error -32000: Connection closed". The new `StdioServerParameters` TypeScript error might be preventing the test from correctly setting up the transport, or the SUT is still crashing for other reasons (e.g., environment variables not fully propagated or SUT-side issues).
    *   **`src/tests/server.test.ts`:** 4/28 tests still failed (all in `startProxyServer` suite due to timeouts). The previous fixes to `startProxyServer` in `src/lib/server.ts` did not resolve these timeouts.
    *   **Analysis/Retrospection (Attempt 107 Results):**
        *   **`src/index.ts` / `yargs` is the primary suspect for `index.test.ts` failures and unhandled rejections.** The `yargs.fail()` handler at `src/index.ts:691` (`throw new Error(msg)`) is causing tests to fail unexpectedly when yargs reports "Unknown argument". The root cause is likely that yargs is misinterpreting arguments passed via `runMainWithArgs` (e.g. `['start']`, `['/some/path']`, `['agent_query', '{...}']`). This needs to be the top priority.
        *   The "promise resolved instead of rejecting" errors in `index.test.ts` are likely a consequence of the yargs fail handler not behaving as tests expect (e.g., not causing `process.exit` to be called in a way that the mock can throw and reject the promise).
        *   The `StdioClientTransport` constructor not being called in client command tests is also likely due to yargs failing before client logic is reached.
        *   **Integration test failures ("Connection closed")** are very likely a downstream effect of the SUT (server process) crashing on startup due to the same yargs argument parsing issues when it's spawned by the client CLI portion of the SUT.
        *   **`server.test.ts` timeouts** in `startProxyServer` remain a persistent, separate issue, likely related to promise handling within `startProxyServer` itself under specific mock conditions (especially when `findFreePort` is mocked to reject) or complex interactions with `nock` and `http.createServer` mocks.
*   **Applied Changes (leading to current state):**
    *   Commit `f6f4f36` ("fix: Fix yargs parsing, update fail handler tests, reduce server timeouts") applied the changes from Attempt 108.
*   **Result (Based on User's `npm run build` Output after `f6f4f36`):**
    *   (Output for `npm run build` after `f6f4f36` is pending from the user)
*   **Analysis/Retrospection (Anticipating results for Attempt 108):**
    *   The changes to `src/index.ts` (yargs command definitions and `.fail()` handler) are expected to resolve most of the "Unknown argument" errors and unhandled rejections in `src/tests/index.test.ts`.
    *   The adjustments to assertions in `src/tests/index.test.ts` (expecting `console.error` and specific error throws) should align with the new yargs behavior, leading to more passing tests.
    *   The `mockProcessExit` configuration in `src/tests/index.test.ts` should now correctly simulate process exits, allowing tests for `--version`, `--help`, etc., to pass.
    *   The fix for `readFileSync` paths in the changelog test should resolve that specific failure.
    *   If the yargs argument parsing issues were indeed causing the SUT to crash in integration tests (`stdio-client-server.integration.test.ts`), those tests should now show improvement (i.e., fewer "Connection closed" errors).
    *   The changes to `src/lib/server.ts` (ensuring `startProxyServer` resolves with `null` if `findFreePort` rejects) and the refined mocks in `src/tests/server.test.ts` (especially for the `should resolve with null if findFreePort fails` test and reduced timeouts) are aimed at fixing the `startProxyServer` timeouts.

## Attempt 108: Stabilizing yargs, CLI tests, and then Integration/Server tests (Applied)

*   **Attempt Number:** 108
*   **Last Git Commit for this attempt's changes:** `f6f4f36` ("fix: Fix yargs parsing, update fail handler tests, reduce server timeouts")
*   **Intended Fixes (from this Attempt 108):**
    *   **`src/index.ts`:**
        *   Revised yargs command definitions (default `$0` and `start`) to correctly handle `repoPath` and avoid "Unknown argument" errors.
        *   Modified the `yargs.fail()` handler for consistent error throwing in tests and proper logging/exit in production.
    *   **`src/tests/index.test.ts`:**
        *   Adjusted assertions for `yargs.fail()` to expect `console.error` and specific error throws.
        *   Ensured `mockProcessExit` throws to simulate exit for promise rejection tests.
        *   Corrected `readFileSync` mock paths for changelog test.
        *   Refined JSON output test assertions.
    *   **`src/lib/server.ts` (for `startProxyServer`):**
        *   Ensured `startProxyServer` resolves with `null` if `findFreePort()` rejects.
    *   **`src/tests/server.test.ts` (for `startProxyServer` timeouts):**
        *   Refined `findFreePort` mock for rejection test.
        *   Reduced timeouts for successful proxy tests.
*   **Applied Changes:** Changes from commit `f6f4f36` have been applied by the user.
*   **Result:** (Pending user execution of `npm run build` with `f6f4f36` changes)
*   **Analysis/Retrospection:** (Will be filled after results)
*   **Next Steps/Plan (Attempt 108 - Post-Application):**
    1.  **`DEBUG_SESSION.MD`:** Update with this current status (this step).
    2.  **Verification:** User to run `npm run build` with the `f6f4f36` changes and provide the full output.
    3.  **Analyze new build output,** focusing on:
        *   Confirmation that `tsc` passes.
        *   Status of `src/tests/index.test.ts`.
        *   Status of `src/tests/integration/stdio-client-server.integration.test.ts`.
        *   Status of `src/tests/server.test.ts`, particularly the `startProxyServer` timeouts.
    4.  Based on the new output, formulate a plan for Attempt 109.

### Blockers (Anticipated based on current analysis)
*   Subtle yargs parsing edge cases might still exist.
*   `startProxyServer` timeouts in `server.test.ts` might persist if the root cause is a complex mock interaction not yet fully addressed.
*   Integration test SUT crashes could still occur if there are other SUT startup issues beyond yargs argument parsing.
