# Source File Documentation

This section provides a high-level overview of the key source files within the CodeCompass project. The aim is to help contributors quickly understand the purpose and main responsibilities of each module.

Each Markdown file in this directory corresponds to a TypeScript file in the `src/` directory, covering key components of the CodeCompass project. This includes:

-   Core libraries (primarily from `src/lib/`)
-   Utility modules (from `src/utils/`)
-   Scripts (from `src/scripts/`)
-   Main application entry points and type definitions.

## Structure

-   Each file documentation will typically include:
    -   **File Path**: The full path to the source file.
    -   **Purpose**: A brief description of what the file/module does.
    -   **Key Responsibilities/Exports**: A list or summary of the main functions, classes, or variables exported and their roles.
    -   **Notes (Optional)**: Any other relevant information, such as dependencies on other modules or important design considerations.

This documentation is intended to be a starting point. For detailed understanding, always refer to the source code and its inline comments.
